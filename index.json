It\u0026rsquo;s basically a block-level html code; you can write shortcodes yourself and find ones online that others have written for you. You have two sets of curly braces and a set of angle brackets { { \u0026lt; short code \u0026gt; } }. (For some reason the website won\u0026rsquo;t compile if I actually type it out correctly, which is without the spaces between each symbols.) Some shortcodes have opening and closing tags like html and some do not.\nHow can I find \u0026ldquo;built-in\u0026rdquo; shortcodes? Under the themes/layouts/shorcodes folder, you can find the ones that come with your theme. For example, here are some that come with the PaperMod theme:\nBlockquote here\u0026rsquo;s some text presented in a blockquote shortcode\nCollapse here\u0026rsquo;s a demonstration for how the collapse shortcodes work you can have a lot of things inside but you can\u0026rsquo;t have Markdown Syntax inside of shortcode :\u0026lt; Figure this is a centered caption\nWhat if I want to embed something else that doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with my theme? Let\u0026rsquo;s take YouTube videos as an example. PaperMod doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with a shortcode for YouTube embedding, but fortunately hugo does! Under layout, you can add a folder named shortcodes and a youtube.html file insdie, mimicking the structure of your theme\u0026rsquo;s theme/layout/shortcodes. When hugo generates your site, it will prioritize your own html\u0026rsquo;s rather than the ones that came with the theme. On hugo\u0026rsquo;s shortcode page, we can find the html file for embedding YouTube videos, which we will copy and paste to the youtube.html file. Then, in the markdown file that you\u0026rsquo;d like to embed a YouTube video, employ the shortcode like how you would with any other shortcodes. Ta-da!\nWhat about writing my own shortcode? That\u0026rsquo;s definitely a great idea! We will have more control over how we can embed the content of our choice. I\u0026rsquo;ll return the topic later with another tutorial.\nHope that was helpful :) Sources HUGO: Shortcodes Mike Dane\u0026rsquo;s YouTube video ","permalink":"https://emilygong-zhuying.github.io/tutorials/shortcode/","summary":"What is a shortcode?

In short, it\u0026rsquo;s a really fast and simple way to have a static website to yourself, through which you can display your recent projects, share your thoughts, and have fun with it.\nBefore we officially start\u0026hellip; The tutorial is based on macOS and I\u0026rsquo;m using GitHub Pages for deployment.\nTools you\u0026rsquo;ll need Terminal A text editor like VSCode A GitHub account hugo Setting up Open your terminal - easy! ‚≠êÔ∏è tip: command + space and search terminal in your Spotlight\nInstall hugo brew install hugo To check that hugo is properly installed,\nhugo version Your terminal should look something like\nhugo v0.101.0+extended darwin/arm64 BuildDate=unknown Install git git --version If you already have git installed, it will look something like\ngit version 2.35.0 If not, the command will automatically prompt installation.\nNow\u0026hellip; How do we actually make the website? Build it locally first Locate a Directory and Create a New Site! You may want to cd into a specific directory for your new website, such as your Documents or Desktop. For this tutorial, I will create a new directory\ncd Desktop hugo new site yourPreferredFolderName I will use personalWebsite as my folder name.\nAdd a Theme and Edit the Config File While you can certainly create your own theme, there are many themes premade for you. For simplicity, I will choose a theme called PaperMod (because I like its minimalist design). There are many different ways to install a theme, and I would recommend you to check out the Installation page for your theme of choice. For PaperMod,\ncd personalWebsite git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod Once that\u0026rsquo;s done, you should see a folder named PaperMod being created in your themes folder. Now, head to your config file. Based on how the author of your theme decided to implement the config file, it may be in toml or yml or json. Just follow the format you see and add theme = \u0026quot;the same as theme name (exactly the folder name) in your themes folder\u0026quot;. In my case, since it\u0026rsquo;s in yml, I would add a line that says theme: \u0026quot;PaperMod\u0026quot; in my config file.\nThemes usually also provide sample config.yml files, of which you can definitely take advantage.\nAdd some content This step isn\u0026rsquo;t completely necessary, but it provides you a base for visualizing the website. Following the quick start guide provided by Hugo, we will add a post under the posts folder. After the following command,\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md you should be able to find a new file in the content/posts folder named my-first-post.md. Open your text editor, and you should find a markdown file with a front matter that looks something like this\n--- title: \u0026#34;My First Post\u0026#34; date: 2019-03-26T08:47:11+01:00 draft: true --- You can add any text, pictures, links, etc. that you like underneath the front matter. Make sure to save the file in your text editor before moving on to the next step.\nCheck it Out in Your Browser! hugo server -D The -D stands for drafts, so it will render posts even if draft: true is being included. Copy the link http://localhost:1313/ into your browser and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to check it out!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time to publish it! There are many ways to host your website, such as using services like netlify. GitHub also has an amazing feature called GitHub Pages that lets you host your personal website for free.\nunfinished\u0026hellip; still editing\nSources Hugo: Quick Start Medium: Build a Personal Website With Github Pages and Hugo YouTube: Getting Started With Hugo | FREE COURSE Git: Installing Git ","permalink":"https://emilygong-zhuying.github.io/tutorials/hugowebsite/","summary":"Why building a website with Hugo?
