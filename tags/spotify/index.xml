      <description>In this group project I led, we tried to predict K-Pop song‚Äôs popularity through machine learning and natural language processing.
We were first inspired by the BTS 147 Songs Audio Features (Spotify) dataset from Kaggle, but to conduct our analysis, we referred to the following two datasets: the Kpop Artists and Full Spotify Discography and BTS Lyrics dataset (more details in later sections).
Before proceeding, we extracted the ‚ÄúPopularity‚Äù scores Spotify generated for each song we observed through the Spotify API and appended it to the datasets mentioned above.</description>
